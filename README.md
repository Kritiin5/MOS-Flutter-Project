**Description:**  <br>
The MOS Directory app is a comprehensive guide to modern operating systems directory, providing a structured approach to learning about different units and subunits. <br>
The app allows users to navigate through units, view subunits, and access keynote presentations for each subunit.

**Features:** <br>
* *Home Screen:* Displays multiple units of the MOS directory. <br>
* *Unit Screen:* Opens up upon clicking a unit, showing the subunits of that unit. <br>
* *Subunit Screen:* Displays the keynote presentations for a subunit, with a back button to return to the unit screen. <br>

**Purpose:** <br>
* To make a desktop image, which allows for launching the app from the desktop without having to open VSCode. <br>
* To make it compatible with different Operating Systems, here MacOS, and Linux. <br>

**Main Screen (MyApp):** <br>
* Displays the home screen with multiple units as card widgets.<br>
* Displays the main screen of the app with a custom app bar and two GestureDetector widgets for navigating to different units. <br>
* Each GestureDetector widget represents a card containing an image and title for a unit, acting as a preview to the keynote presentation. <br>

**Note:** Each of these units contain the first and last subunitsâ€™ presentations only.<br>

**Unit Subunits (UnitxSubs):** <br>
* Displays the subunits for Unit 1 with images and titles. <br>
* Each subunit is represented as a card widget showing the preview image of the keynote presentation <br>
* Uses the url_launcher package to launch external URLs when a subunit is tapped. <br>
* Each of the Subunits page have a back button to return to the Units screen. <br>

**Steps to Use:** <br>
* Clone the repository and open the project in a Flutter-compatible IDE. <br>
* Ensure all dependencies are installed by running flutter pub get. <br>
* Run the app on a simulator or physical device to view the MOS Directory.  <br>

1. Launch the app on your device. <br>
2. Navigate through the units on the home screen. <br>
3. Click on a unit to view its subunits. <br>
4. Click on a subunit to view the keynote presentation. <br>
5. Use the back button to return to the previous screen. <br>


**Future Scope:** <br>
* Implement search functionality to allow users to search for specific units or subunits. <br>
* Add a favorites feature to allow users to bookmark units or subunits for quick access. <br>
* Incorporate a settings screen to allow users to customize the app's appearance and behavior. <br>
